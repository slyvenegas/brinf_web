You may write me down in history <br>
With your bitter, twisted lies, <br>
You may trod me in the very dirt <br>
But still, like dust, I'll rise.<br>
<br>
Does my sassiness upset you?<br>
Why are you beset with gloom?<br>
’Cause I walk like I've got oil wells<br>
Pumping in my living room.<br>
<br>
Just like moons and like suns,<br>
With the certainty of tides,<br>
Just like hopes springing high,<br>
Still I'll rise.<br>

Did you want to see me broken?<br>
Bowed head and lowered eyes?<br>
Shoulders falling down like teardrops,<br>
Weakened by my soulful cries?<br>
<br>
Does my haughtiness offend you?<br>
Don't you take it awful hard<br>
’Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines<br>
Diggin’ in my own backyard.<br>
<br>
You may shoot me with your words,<br>
You may cut me with your eyes,<br>
You may kill me with your hatefulness,<br>
But still, like air, I’ll rise.<br>
<br>
Does my sexiness upset you?<br>
Does it come as a surprise<br>
That I dance like I've got diamonds<br>
At the meeting of my thighs?<br>
<br>
Out of the huts of history’s shame<br>
I rise<br>
Up from a past that’s rooted in pain<br>
I rise<br>
I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,<br>
Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.<br>
<br>
Leaving behind nights of terror and fear<br>
I rise<br>
Into a daybreak that’s wondrously clear<br>
I rise<br>
Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,<br>
I am the dream and the hope of the slave.<br>
I rise<br>
I rise<br>
I rise.<br>
<br>
<br>
Still I Rise| Maya Angelou
