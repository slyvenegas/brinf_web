        "Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth
        <br />
        And danced the skies on laughter-silvered wings;
        <br />
        Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth
        <br />
        of sun-split clouds,—and done a hundred things
        <br /><br />
        You have not dreamed of—wheeled and soared and swung 
        <br />
        High in the sunlit silence. Hov'ring there, 
        <br />
        I've chased the shouting wind along, and flung 
        <br />
        My eager craft
        through footless halls of air ....
        <br /><br />

        Up, up the long, delirious, burning blue 
        <br />
        I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace 
        <br />
        Where never lark, or even eagle flew— 
        <br />
        And, while with silent lifting mind I've trod 
        <br />
        The high untrespassed sanctity of space, 
        <br />Put out my hand, and touched the face of God.
